 JavaChecker -  static analyzer of Java source code, based on
 TermWare technology.

  This tool allows to detect code defects, such as:

   - inaccurate exceptions handling (empty catch block, throwing of generic
     exceptions and so on) 
   - hiding defects (for example, when name of memebr variable is the same,
      as name of formal parameter of some methods in the same class)
   - style defects. (you can set style conventions with set of regular expressions)
   - violations of standatd usage contracts (such as overloading equals without
       overloading hashCode) 
   - synchronization defects (for example, when synchronized variable is accessed
       outside synchronized block)

  You can tune set of checks using preferences and special comments. And of course,
    JavaChecker can be called from  ANT scripts.
